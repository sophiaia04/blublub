# Face API

## Overview

This project is a **Face API** that allows for facial recognition and analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning models. The API is designed to detect and recognize faces in images, providing useful data such as face attributes (age, gender, emotions) and face landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth positions). This tool can be integrated into various applications requiring facial recognition capabilities.

## Features

- **Face Detection:** Detects faces in images with bounding boxes.
- **Face Attributes:** Returns attributes such as age, gender, emotion, and more.
- **Face Recognition:** Recognizes specific individuals by comparing facial features.
- **Emotion Detection:** Analyzes the emotional state of individuals from facial expressions.
- **Face Landmarks:** Identifies key facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth.
- **Customizable:** Configurable to support multiple image formats and integrate with other systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
- **Libraries:** dlib, face_recognition, numpy
- **Cloud APIs:** [Include any cloud-based face recognition APIs, if applicable]
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-api.git
   cd face-api
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```

3. **Install required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

The Face API can be used either as a standalone application or integrated into other systems. Below is an example of how to use the API in a Python script.

### 1. **Face Detection Example**

```python
import face_recognition
import cv2

# Load an image
image = cv2.imread("path_to_image.jpg")

# Convert the image to RGB
rgb_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# Detect faces in the image
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(rgb_image)

# Draw rectangles around the faces
for (top, right, bottom, left) in face_locations:
    cv2.rectangle(image, (left, top), (right, bottom), (0, 255, 0), 2)

# Show the resulting image
cv2.imshow("Face Detection", image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### 2. **Face Recognition Example**

```python
import face_recognition

# Load images
image_of_person_1 = face_recognition.load_image_file("person1.jpg")
image_of_person_2 = face_recognition.load_image_file("person2.jpg")

# Get face encodings for each image
person_1_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(image_of_person_1)[0]
person_2_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(image_of_person_2)[0]

# Compare faces
results = face_recognition.compare_faces([person_1_face_encoding], person_2_face_encoding)
print(f"Are these two faces the same person? {results[0]}")
```

## API Endpoints

If you are exposing the Face API as a web service, here are some example endpoints:

### 1. **POST /api/face-detection**

- **Description:** Detect faces in an image.
- **Request Body:** Multipart image file.
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "faces": [
      {
        "bounding_box": {"top": 50, "right": 100, "bottom": 150, "left": 75},
        "attributes": {"age": 30, "gender": "male", "emotion": "neutral"}
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### 2. **POST /api/recognize-face**

- **Description:** Recognize a face and check if it matches a stored image.
- **Request Body:** Multipart image file of the person to recognize.
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "recognized": true,
    "person_name": "John Doe"
  }
  ```

## Example Use Cases

- **Security and Authentication:** Using face recognition for secure login.
- **Customer Insights:** Analyzing emotions of customers for improved service.
- **Healthcare:** Detecting patient emotions for better care.
- **Retail:** Customer recognition and personalized offers.
